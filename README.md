# uberstrike-assemblies
A modified UberStrike client, made to be used with the v0.1.0-alpha branch of [SirAnuse/uberstrok](https://github.com/SirAnuse/uberstrok/tree/v0.1.0-alpha).

# Features
- Ability to select game flags from game creation menu
- Various fixes to the game client and quality of life improvements

This list is incomplete, and will be updated as I update the client itself.
